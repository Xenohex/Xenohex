- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xenohex
- 👀 I’m interested in programming of many kinds and ethical hacking at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and software engineering at school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... learning I guess idk.
- 📫 How to reach me ... just message me here.

- I am new to the programming scene. I am learning in school and on my own. I do not know a whole lot but I certainly know more than the average person.
- If you have tips, suggestions, or recommendations of any kind for learning sources or tips on my code, they are all appreciated.
