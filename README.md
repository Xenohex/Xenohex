- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xenohex
- 👀 I’m interested in programming of many kinds and ethical hacking at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my C# / .NET skills and I am learning full-stack web development as well.
- 💞️ I will gladly collaborate on any learning projects of probably any kind if you ask.
- 📫 You can add me on discord @xenohex or get my attention here somehow to get a hold of me. If you add me on discord just mention you are coming from github and why you adding me.

- I am new to the programming scene. I am learning in school and on my own. I do not know a whole lot but learning is all part of the game.
- If you have tips, suggestions, or recommendations of any kind for learning sources or tips on my code, they are all appreciated.
