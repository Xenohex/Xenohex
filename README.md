- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xenohex
- 👀 I’m interested in programming of many kinds and ethical hacking. However, most of my focus right now goes into school.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my C# / .NET skills and I am learning full-stack web development as well.
- 💞️ I will gladly collaborate on any learning projects of probably any kind if you ask.
- 📫 You can add me on discord @xenohex or get my attention here somehow to get a hold of me. If you add me on discord just mention you are coming from github and why you are adding me.

**My languages:**
- C
- C# / .NET
  - MVC
  - Blazor
- Java
- Python
- Haskell
- MySQL
- HTML / CSS

**My experienced workflow:**

**Software:**

- I am new to the programming scene. I am learning in school and on my own. I do not know a whole lot but learning is all part of the game.
- If you have tips, suggestions, or recommendations of any kind for learning sources or tips on my code, they are all appreciated.
